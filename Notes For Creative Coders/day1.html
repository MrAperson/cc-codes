    <h3>
      I will share lectures, syntax and everything I learned with knowledge
      based blog
    </h3>
    <h4>1. Creating Files and Type of File Format</h4>
    <p>
      1. The very first lesson is the importance initialization of a program by
      craeting a file. Then, the second step is to create a text file. In this
      case, we need to identify our file with proper format. Today, we are
      writing our texts in html. So the program will end with (.html).
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>2. Tags that we use in a html file</h4>x
    <h5>1. h tag</h5>
    <p>
      - First, we will start with h tag. It is used in html with opening and
      closing tags. (&lt;h1&gt;) is opening tag, (&lt;/h1&gt;) is closing tag,
      we write our heading name between opening tag and closing tag per
      &lt;h1&gt; Heading &lt;/h1&gt;.We use h tag to write headings of
      paragraphs like titles. We use h tag in 6 ways. h1 is the biggest one and
      get smaller than smaller per h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. We can see that h1 is
      biggest while h6 is the smallest. ** note that the word (title) here is
      not a syntax, more on that later.
    </p>
    <h5>2. p tag</h5>
    <p>
      - Second, we will use p tag in order to write some paragraphs on our
      webpage. We use p tag by &lt;p&gt; Our Paragraph &lt;/p&gt;. We can
      clearly see that p tag also has both opening and closing tags.
    </p>
    <h5>3. lorem</h5>
    <p>
      - Third one is something called lorem. lorem is a free website that gives
      us some random paragraphs to test our html programs. In this case, the p
      tag. We can easily get paragraphs from lorem by simpliy googling the word
      "lorem" and get along with the website. Luckily, we can get lorem's
      paragraphs in html file automatically without any necessary of browsing
      the lorem website. **We will see that when we use VScode text editor, more
      on that later.
    </p>
    <h5>4. head tag and body tag</h5>
    <p>
      - I am going to write both head tag in body tag in the same paragraph
      because they have the simple basic principles so far. The head tag is a
      tag we used to describe our program's tab part when we run the code in the
      browser. &lt;head&gt; Codes Of The Head Part &lt;/head&gt;. The body tag
      is used when we want to show our full webpage on the website, this is why
      its called the body part. We can use body tag per &lt;body&gt; Codes Of
      The Body Part &lt;/body&gt;.
    </p>
    <h5>5. html tag</h5>
    <p>
      - Like its name, the html tag is used whenever we want to write html
      codes, which means everything will be written between html tag. e.g,
      &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;\head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </p>
    <h5>6. title tag</h5>
    <p>
      - We can name our tab with title tag and some content in between with
      &lt;title&gt; Tab Name &lt;/title&gt;. The title tag will be written in
      &lt;head&gt;&lt;\head&gt;(tab part) of our code.
    </p>
    <h5>7. hr tag</h5>
    <p>
      - The hr tag is a tag that doesn't have a closing tag, which we called
      self-closing tag, meaning we don't need to write any content in between.
      The usage of hr tag is texting &lt;hr\&gt; to draw a horizontal rule or
      line to separate our contents with a black line.
    </p>
    <h5>8. img tag</h5>
    <p>
      - The img tag is a tag we can use to add some images to our codes. &lt;img
      src=""&gt;. We can see that img tag is one of the self-closing tags as it
      doesn't have any closing tag. But here we can see something strange inside
      the img tag, src="", that's the attribute of the img tag where we can add
      our images between two double quotes. If we are adding a local photo, we
      just simply use the attribute like this, &lt;img
      src="./imagefilename.format"&gt;. Or if we are adding a photo from a
      brower or whatever online, we just need to add the image address inside
      the src attribute per &lt;img src="imageAddress"&gt;. **note that we only
      need to add (./) if we want to use a local photo and not necessary in
      internet based photo.**also note that local photo should be in the same
      folder of our html file.
    </p>
    <h5>9. link tag</h5>
    <p>
      - Lastly, we will use the link tag in our head part so that we can see
      what appear on our tab part of our webpage. link tag aslo is a
      self-closing tag, &lt;link rel="" href=""&gt;. The href attribute is used
      to add some local image or online image address. The rel attribute is used
      to identify what type of usage we want to do that with that photo, we will
      type 'icon' so that we will be able to see that photo on our tab icon. The
      link tag is written between head tag. e.g, &lt;head&gt; &lt;link
      rel="icon" href="FileAddress"&gt; &lt;/head&gt;.
    </p>
    <h5>10. !DOCTYPE tag</h5>
    <p>
      - This is where we declare our file type. It is written at the top of our
      code. We are coding in html, so we will type like this, &lt;!DOCTYPE
      html&gt;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>3. TextEditor or CodeEditor</h4>
    <h5>1. VsCode</h5>
    <p>
      - We use VsCode to write our code. It is very user friendly and free to
      download. we used VsCode in our class today. **VsCode has so many features
      like highlighting our codes with different colors, syntax suggestions and
      automatically generated lorem paragraphs.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>4. Useful Extensions in VsCode</h4>
    <h5>1. Prettier</h5>
    <p>
      - We can download any extensions in extensions tool. Prettier is an
      extension that automatically makeup our code in pretty way. First, we
      install Prettier extension and we do this manage->settings->default
      formatter-> choose prettier-> mark format on save
    </p>
    <h5>2. Live Server</h5>
    <p>
      - This is the extension that we can use to run our programming on live in
      any given browser we chose without any need of refreshing our webpage. we
      can just download 'Live Server' extension, and then we can enable that by
      clicking the Live Server icon at the bottom of VsCode.
    </p>
    <h5>3. Themes</h5>
    <p>
      - We can choose theme for our code editor. Just simply find some vscode
      themes on google, then type it in extensions. Install and apply.
